SpellChecker is a stand-alone API, capable of operating on a block of word that may not be spelled correctly.

A SpellChecker carries out the following processes:
1. It scans the text and extracts the words contained in it.
2. It then compares each word with a known list of correctly spelled words (i.e. a dictionary).
3. Returns List of suggested words incase word entered is incorrect.

SpellChecker is highly optimized for faster and improved results and is completely written in JavaSE.
